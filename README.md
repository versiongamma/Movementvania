# Movementvania

### So have you ever heard of Super Metroid? Well, our idea is to create a game in a similar style, but with one catch. You can’t shoot anyone.

Combat has been a crutch of game design pretty much since its inception. Try and think of a game that doesn't feature combat in some way. You probably don't have a lot of examples, right? So, we've challenged ourselves to see whether or not you can make a compelling experience without weapons. If you’ve played a game like Super Metroid, Hollow Knight, or Axiom Verge (known as a Metroidvania), we plan to create a game in a similar style, where you explore through a world, and you unlock new power ups that allow you to progress to different areas of the game, except all of those power ups are about movement, rather than combat.

>So TL;DR, a Metroidvania, but all the powerups are movement based. No weapons, no guns, no punching, only movement.

## Features

- Power Ups that extend your movement abilities. Starting with no movement abilities 

- Full grid based map, with sections that are gated by the different power ups. Think of the map of a typical Metroidvania.


- Exploration, with the explorable area gradually increasing as you progress.

- Challenges are based on platforming, or puzzles. 

- Designed for desktop, with either keyboard input, or both keyboard and controller.

- Game menu, with power up tracking, a map of where you have explored, and other user settings. 

- 2d game camera, based on different sections, like shown below

- Music
